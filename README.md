# Job Web App using React + Vite, Tailwind CSS and JSON Server

This is my Front-End project using React JS and JSON Server. My goal on creating this application is to understand how API works and to enhance my skills in web design responsiveness.

## Here's a step-by-step procedure on how to clone and run this React JS project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Open Terminal or Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project: "cd /path/to/your/directory"
3. Clone the repository using Git: "git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-reactjs-project.git"

### Step 2: Navigate into the Project Directory and Install Dependencies

1. Go to the project directory: "cd your-reactjs-project"
2. Install the necessary dependencies using "npm install" or "yarn install"

### Step 3: Start the JSON Server

1. There is an exising json file located in the src. "./src/jobs.json"
2. Run the script using "npm run server" or "yarn start:server"

### Step 4: Start the React App

1. Run the start script to start the React development server: "npm start" or "yarn start"

### After following the steps above, the app will open in your default browser.

### Additional Notes

1. If the project uses a different package manager (e.g., pnpm), adjust the commands accordingly.
2. Some projects might require additional configuration or environment variables to run properly. Refer to the project' README or documentation for specific instructions.
3. If you encounter any errors, double-check the steps and consult the project's documentation or online resources for troubleshooting guidance.
